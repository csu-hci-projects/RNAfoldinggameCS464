# RNA Folding Virtual Reality Game

The following project aims to create a game that allows people to predict RNA folding. This is a semester long project for a the senior level undergraduate course CS646 on Human-computer interaction (HCI). 

## Introduction 

The main objective of the project aims to successfully integrate an RNA folding simulation game into a virtual reality environment. This game is intended for the purpose of educating its participants in RNA folding, and will lay down the groundwork for future 3D development. The constituent parts of the projectâ€™s objective includes research and development for game design, especially with regards to virtual reality. Additionally the experimentation process will consider previous work and research, and likely take careful consideration into the testing pool of our experiment due to the lack of training time the game has to teach and inform participants. This should prove to not be a problem since the end goal of the experiment aims to solidify existing hypotheses on the heightened human performance in predicting RNA folding patterns over computers.
