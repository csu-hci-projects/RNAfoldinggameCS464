# Menu Design on 2D Interfaces

The following project aims to create a game that allows people to predict RNA folding. This is a semester long project for a the senior level undergraduate course CS646 on Human-computer interaction (HCI). 

## Introduction 

The main objective of the project aims to successfully integrate an RNA folding simulation game into a virtual reality environment. This game is intended for the purpose of educating its participants in RNA folding, and will lay down the groundwork for future 3D development. The constituent parts of the projectâ€™s objective includes research and development for game design, especially with regards to virtual reality. Additionally the experimentation process will consider previous work and research, and likely take careful consideration into the testing pool of our experiment due to the lack of training time the game has to teach and inform participants. This should prove to not be a problem since the end goal of the experiment aims to solidify existing hypotheses on the heightened human performance in predicting RNA folding patterns over computers.

#### Description
* Gonzalez, Kaszynski, Young and Stodghill originally set outto conduct a research experiment and report on RNA manipu-lation within a three-dimensional virtual setting. This was tobe done for the efficiency manipulation in three-dimensionsprovided, as well as the novelty of creating an RNA structuresimulator in a three-dimensional virtual setting. However, dueto arguably unforeseen events, COVID-19 prevented the ma-jority of the research process required, and the research teamwas forced to adapt to a different goal. The new goal for theresearch team was determined to be a similar, but much sim-pler experiment involving an open-source Unity game, virtualmenu layouts, and conducted virtually using online resources.Alongside this, the paper includes a plethora of literature re-views to enhance their understanding of virtual menu systemsand user interface navigation.  This paper will cover thesereviews as well as review the process and end result of theconducted menu experiment.
